# Better Damage Counter

### Overview
This plugin is an enhancement on the Damage Counter plugin that is integrated into Runelite. However, if you've used 
that plugin you may have noticed that the damage doesn't save after the fight is over, and if you've done a multi-stage
boss, the damage doesn't keep rolling in between the phases, meaning you have to manually scroll through your logs
to see how much damage you did. 

This plugin aims to fix that issue by:
1) Keep a record of the fights locally in a basic JSON format
2) Display the records in a side panel in Runelite
